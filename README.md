# Digital Clock Project ‚è∞

This project is a digital clock designed using Quartus software with a 3.51 MHz oscillator frequency. The clock features a multiplexed display in common cathode mode on a BCD 7-segment display. It shows 6 characters: hours, minutes, and seconds in a 24-hour format. The clock also includes an adjustable alarm.

## Main Components of the Clock

### 1. Frequency Divider üîÑ

The frequency divider is created using counters arranged in a cascade to handle the clock frequency and create the necessary time base.

### 3. Control Logic with Reset at 24 Hours ‚ôªÔ∏è

The control logic is composed of buttons and a reset mechanism for resetting the clock after 24 hours.

### 4. Alarm System üîî

The alarm is composed of a memory block and a 13-bit comparator to set and trigger the alarm.
